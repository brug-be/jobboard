# ABOUT POOTSY

Pootsy is a real-time booking platform for professional home services.
Thousands of Workers of Professional Companies deliver Home Services (Cleaning, Gardening, Beauty, Baby Sitting,…) every day to millions of customers in Belgium and Europe. But they don’t have the digital tools they deserve to help them everyday (yet).
So, we are on a mission. Digitalize the experience of Professional Home Services. For everyone: Companies, Workers and Customers.

# Working at Pootsy

Pootsy’s offices are located in the center of Brussels (Centre Dansaert) and homeworking is encouraged.

Working at Pootsy typically means that you take part in our discussions about architectures and the future of the product, the — timeboxed ! — scrum meetings and that you love Slack as much as we do (and we really do).

If work alone is not enough fun, we usually lunch together on Friday, we play ping-pong, we drink all kinds of (non-)alcoholic beverages and we barbecue.

Not to mention a highly competitive salary package.

Sounds like fun? Please, contact me and let’s grab a beer or a coffee :) I’m paul@pootsy.be
