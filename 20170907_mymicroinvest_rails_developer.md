We’re looking for a full-time Ruby on Rails developer with a real passion for collaboration, problem-solving, and happiness at work to join our team.

![Stack](https://storage.googleapis.com/mymicroinvest-production/tmp/webstack.png "Our stack")

As an experienced web developer you’ll be responsible to make sure our platform evolves as fast as the business it’s supporting. You are a full stack developer from the (minimal) React front end all the way to optimize our back end database queries. You are not afraid to dive deep in a problem but know when it’s time to ask help.

Working knowledge of English is a requirement, some French or Dutch is welcome but not necessary.

We are located @ [Co.Station](http://co-station.com/), a quirky co-working space, next to the Brussels central railway station. We have a private bicycle parking with warm showers. We work from the office but understand life goes its own way and you are welcome to work from home if need be. We’ll get you a laptop, a big 4K screen, and discuss the pro’s and con’s of Vim and clicky keyboards.

A typical day starts at 9h30 with a standup meeting, some coding and wasting time on Slack, a lunch we like to have together with the team, some more coding and making sure we go home in time so we can see our families.

Do you like Vietnamese food? Every other week we grab the best Phở or Bún bò (you pick) one can find in Brussels and we like our daily dose of quality [caffeine](http://www.apex.coffee/ "APEX coffee") or [tea](https://teh.eu/) (no, Nespresso does not count).

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

We don’t need a ninja or rockstar but someone who writes readable, maintainable code and knows how to get stuff done. Please, don’t send us your CV, we don't care about your past, rather show us what makes you special instead. Get in touch and get to know us, nothing to lose.
