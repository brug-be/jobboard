## About the Role

To help us bring AppTweak to the next level, you will work closely with the product team, the front-end team, and of course the other backend developers.

As a senior developer, we expect you to have a strong understanding of the current tech environment and help us make the right decisions by understanding business requirements and translating these into strong scalable systems.

Once the technical design is complete, we expect you to take part in the implementation and report the progress to the management and product team. You will integrate our team of talented backend developers. Your focus will be to:

* Architecture and build scrapers and ETL pipelines that ingest the data that power AppTweak
* Architecture and build API's that make those data available
* Monitor and optimize our message queue systems
* Monitor and optimize our infrastructure.

## The Tech we use

Our SAAS product is a Ruby on Rails application serving a React Single Page Application.

Our scrapers and crawlers get their tasks from SQS queues and store data in a mix of MySQL, Redshift, MongoDB, PgSQL, and Elasticsearch databases. They are built using the Ruby programming language (without Rails).

Our JSON REST API's are built in Ruby as well using the Sinatra lightweight framework. We deploy code straight from Slack using Concourse as a CI/CD pipeline that builds Docker images deployed on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS.

We also have several Python services, mainly to run ML models developed by our data scientists.

We monitor everything using Prometheus and Grafana to visualize time series and metrics in an efficient manner.

We follow an agile development process inspired by SCRUM, but adapted to our needs.

## Responsibilities

* Design of the overall architecture of the web application
* Implementation of a robust set of services and APIs to power the web application
* Building reusable code and libraries for future use
* Optimization of the application for maximum speed and scalability

## Requirements

* Bachelor or master degree in computer science or engineering
* 3 to 5 years of experience writing backend code. Ruby is a plus.
* Creating database schemas that represent and support business processes.
* Data migration, transformation, and scripting doesn't scare you.
* Experience with AWS / Kubernetes / Docker is a plus
* VISA sponsor possible
